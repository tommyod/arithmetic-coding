# arithmetic-coding

Python implementation of arithmetic encoding/decoding for lossless data compression.

- I wrote the code to understand the algorithm after reading the classic 1987 paper "Arithmetic coding for data compression."
- My focus was a clean, correct and modern Python implementation - not a state-of-the-art implementation.
- Python is too slow and too high level to make this code production ready.
- There are thousands of parametrized tests verifying the correctness of this implementation.

## Example

Here's an example showing how to use the `ArithmeticEncoder`.

```pycon
>>> from arithmetic_coding import ArithmeticEncoder
>>> message = ['A', 'B', 'B', 'B', '<EOM>']
>>> frequencies = {'A': 1, 'B': 3, '<EOM>': 1}
>>> encoder = ArithmeticEncoder(frequencies=frequencies)
>>> bits = list(encoder.encode(message))
>>> bits
[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
>>> list(encoder.decode(bits))
['A', 'B', 'B', 'B', '<EOM>']

```
